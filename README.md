# Introduction:
Community Booster is an Event Management Website for people living in close communities to build up and strengthen the connection between neighbours by participating in free events (like parties, weddings, group exercises, yard sales, and open houses, etc.) or helping each other in a paid manner (key/documents/medicine-delivery, lending tools, handyman & technician wanted, PSW, dog walker, plant pots care while travelling etc.).<br>
The functions of this application/website are designed with multiple event lists showing on the webpage. These events are categorized into TWO parts: For Fun (Entertainment) & For FARE (Helper/Side job) within the same community or several close communities. When users browse the event lists, they can choose whatever event they have interest in. A popup will showcase the event's details (Time, Location, Capacity, etc.) by clicking on each event. After reviewing the content and requirements in the popup, users can close it and find some blank spaces listed vertically beside the event of their pick where they are about to put their name in one of them. There is an “Add "button beside each blank. After clicking the" Add” button, the user’s name will show partially (for privacy purposes) on the attendee list.
